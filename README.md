# Note App for Android
A simple Android app developed for the Verizon Connect graduate programme workshop. 

Written in Kotlin, following the MVP architectural pattern. Uses Koin for dependency injection and Room for persistence.

A version for students can be found here: https://github.com/hayuki/android-basic-todo It includes a list of tasks which are marked as TODOs in the code. This mini-project is aimed at complete beginners, so the tasks only touch on the very basic Android constructs like Activities, Fragments, Intents, etc. Anyone is welcome to use this project for their own tutorial sessions.
